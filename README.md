# gps
GPS program in PAIP modified for modern Common Lisp
## what is it?
GPS here is an acronym of General Problem Solver, the word of which gives to readers the wrong impression that the system has the ability to solve any kind of problems. In “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MEETS NATURAL STUPIDITY”, Drew McDermott actually said, “By now, ‘GPS’ is a colorless term denoting a particularly stupid program to solve puzzles. But it originally meant ‘General Problem Solver’, which caused everybody a lot of needless excitement and distraction. It should have been called LFGNS – ‘Local-Feature-Guided Network Searcher’”.
However, it deserves to be evaluated as an early AI system and to have presented the prototype of succeeding plannners.

Actual GPS program was coded by IPL, Information Processing Language, before the advent of LISP, so the program and the AI methodology adopted, the Means End Analysis, was very difficult to read and understand.
This program GPS is coded in Common Lisp in PAIP by Peter Norvig, and it is further modernized here.
